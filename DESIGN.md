# Whatâ€™s Implemented (workdone)

I have created entities like post, follow, like
I have added CRUD functionality for Users (`/api/users`) and other entities
Created routes for each
TypeORM setup using migrations
Basic test script (`test.sh`) 
Clean code and proper routing using Express

This assignment was a big learning curve for me. While I understand the backend logic conceptually, implementing it in this stack took more time than expected.

# Final Note

This project helped me learn a lot, and I plan to continue working on the skills that are required to complete the remaining features.
